## Problem Statement 🤔

analyzing the different combinations of expressions and get the highest value.

## Input Format 📥

- The input contains three integers a, b, and c each separated by a space.
- 1 <= a, b, c <= 10

## Output Format 📤

- Print the maximum value that can be obtained by adding signs and brackets.

## Example

Input:

``` 
1 2 3
```

Output:
```
9
```

## Solution 💡

The solution to this problem is based on the concept of mathematical operations and analyzing the different combinations of expressions. To solve this problem, you can use the max fuction to find the maximum value by testing all possible combinations of operations and brackets.
